We took the kids to the [Tubing Park at Snoqualmie](https://summitatsnoqualmie.com/snow-tubing) this weekend and had a blast. I went up six or seven times and on the last run, managed to work up the courage to go downhill in selfie mode. Toward the end of the run, my tube hopped over the dividing line and into the next lane, leading to speed loss and subsequent whining. Still, it was definitely a fun way to spend a Saturday morning. And it only took us 12 years to discover it!
