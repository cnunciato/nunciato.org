Apparently it has!

Two years ago now -- two _years!_ -- I [wrote a post](/words/its-way-too-quiet-in-here) about how I was totally going to start writing more blog posts. I was geeling pretty good about it, too. I'd just started a new, more content-focused role at work (so was gearing up to do a lot more writing in general), was ready to pick things back up with [my book](https://leanpub.com/pulumi), had just put together the beginnings of a [companion site](https://pulumibook.info/) for it, and had rewritten this site in Hugo, having spent a year or two wrestling with Next.js and finally giving up. I was excited and ready to get going. And then I promptly dove into work and family life, and now, two years later, well, here we are.

I won't say I haven't written _anything_, though. I did write a few things on that [companion site](), for one thing. And I've written reams of [docs](https://pulumi.com/docs) and [blog posts](https://pulumi.com/blog/author/christian-nunciato) at work, along with hundreds of journal entries packed with insanely high-quality, caffeine-fueled insights like this one, for example:

But it's cool -- I know you wanted to, but you probably held back, out of respect; you figured I'd get to it when I could. Which I've appreciated. Or I suppose it's also possible (however unlikely -- I mean let's be honest) that you were off living your _own_ interesting life, completely uninterested in what was happening with mine. Either way, the fact remains: I haven't used this space as well as I could have. And it's time we did something about that.

Here are a few updates.

For the last week or so, I've been getting my
