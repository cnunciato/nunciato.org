Working from home -- as anyone who works from home will tell you -- means you're never quite fully disconnected from the ol' umbilical. If you're doing WFH right, you work at a proper desk during the week -- traditional, standing, adjustable (preferably adjustable) -- with your laptop plugged into a proper monitor, and at the end of the day, you walk away from that desk, turn off your lights, and leave it all behind until tomorrow or Monday. That's how they tell you to do it, and the way you _should_ do it -- the _healthy_ way. Set hard boundaries. Keep a sustainable work-life balance.

There are a dozen stupidly easy ways to screw this up, of course. That laptop, for example, is almost certainly the same one you use to run the everyday business of your life -- personal email, texting with your family, buying groceries, banking (I was about to say _online_ banking, but really -- is there another kind anymore?), so you're always only a half-conscious Command-Tab away from _checking Slack real quick_ and getting sucked into the vortex of a conversation your brain wasn't at all prepared to handle right now. That's one. There are others:

-   **You use the same email client** for both work and personal email. Distraction looms.
-   **You leave Slack open on the laptop**. The nagging badge count awaits. (Also, they see you there, even if you aren't truly _there_. That little dot with the snoozy _z_ is green -- you aren't fooling anyone.)
-   **You have Slack on your phone**. Admirable, but seriously -- way too easy to pop in and get sniped.
-   **You have Slack _notifications_ enabled** on your phone. Now you're just asking for it.
