Good news, friends! I'm writing a book.

In _Pulumi in Action_, I'll be writing about how to use [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com), the open-source project I work on full time, to build cloud applications and infrastructure with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). I'm incredibly excited about this book -- it's my first -- so I'm writing this post as a public expression of that excitement. (My wife often says I don't often emote as much as I should, so I'm attaching an appropriately celebratory emoji as well, lest we be left with any lingering doubt. ðŸŽ‰)

As of now, I've only written the [first few chapters](https://livebook.manning.com/book/pulumi-in-action), but since the book is the first ever focused on Pulumi, [Manning](https://manning.com) (the publisher) wanted to release it as a work-in-progress through [MEAP](https://www.manning.com/meap-program), its early-access program. Thanks to them, you can both read and purchase -- or if you like, read and _not_ purchase -- the book today, and as new chapters roll out, at around once a month, you'll get access to them immediately, in all of the finest digital formats of the day. It'll cover a lot of surface area -- infrastructure as code, Pulumi itself, cloud-native software development and delivery patterns, and more -- and is generally aimed at helping full-stack developers get a solid foothold into the cloud. You can read the first chapter for free [on manning.com](https://www.manning.com/books/pulumi-in-action?a_aid=chris&a_bid=20ca8d8a) today, and browse all of the examples [on GitHub](https://github.com/pulumi-in-action). The print version is scheduled to ship sometime early next year, and should come in at around 300 pages.

So that's it -- that's the post. I _had_ written around two thousand words recounting the tale of how it was that I, a mere web developer, came to write a book about [infrastructure-as-code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code), but my wife, upon reading those words, declared that most of them were unnecessary: what mattered, she pointed out, was what was _in_ the book. So I'll save the full backstory for the eventual preface, and for now, leave you with this: if you're a full-stack developer, you should check out [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com), and when you're ready to learn more, [I'll be here](https://www.manning.com/books/pulumi-in-action?a_aid=chris&a_bid=20ca8d8a).

**Update**: I'm still writing a bookjust not _this_ book. After the better part of a year, I decided to part ways with Manninglong (and rather odd) storyand [publish the book on my own](https://leanpub.com/pulumi). You'll find the _new_ (and still in-progress!) book on Leanpub. [Check it out](https://leanpub.com/pulumi)!
