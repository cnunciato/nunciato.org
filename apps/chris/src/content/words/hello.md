First post! Exciting, right?

It's really more like my five-thousandth, if you count everything I've stuffed into various micro- and regular-sized websites over the years (so many, and nearly all lost to history, alas), but that probably only matters to me, anyway. You're here because -- well, I'm not sure why you're here. But I'm glad you are nonetheless.

I don't have much to share yet, but I will. For now, I'll just say thanks for stopping by, and encourage you to return: I plan to take lots of pictures, make lots of little movies, and write virtual reams (reams, I say!) of words, some of which you might actually enjoy, if we're lucky.

In the meantime, here's a snapshot from a hike we went on recently, at the beautiful [Redmond Watershed Preserve](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/redmond-watershed-preserve).

Have a lovely day, and do come back soon, won't you.
