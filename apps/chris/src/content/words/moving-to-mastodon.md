I'll be honest: I don't _fully_ know what I'm doing, [bailing on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cnunciato/status/1594361226066563072) and [moving to Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@cnunciato), except that it feels like the right thing to do, and it definitely feels like the right time to do it.

I've heard here and there that [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) is a "different" social experience from Twitter, and I haven't fully taken the time to learn how --- but the thought of continuing to hang around on Twitter, with a [nutjob at the helm](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/technology/elon-musk-twitter-workers-quit.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Technology) now and with [Trump reinstated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/technology/trump-twitter-musk.html) (not to mention all the _noise_, _ads_, and relentless self-promotion), just makes me feel sick inside. The last few weeks have made clear what an astonishingly despicable person Elon Musk really is, and I can't bear the idea of lending any more of my time, attention, and creative energy to the business venture of yet another despicable person. I left Facebook in 2008 for the same reason, and aside from missing out on a few family photos from time to time, I haven't regretted that decision since.

So far, [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) looks like an [interesting experiment](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/technology/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk.html?searchResultPosition=5) --- and if the influx of new users over the weekend is any guide, the experiment might actually be working. Most of the people I follow on Twitter are already there, which doesn't hurt. And I love the open and distributed nature of Mastodon, too. Kris [@nova](https://hachyderm.io/@nova) and her colleagues have done an amazing job setting up [hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io) and defining the guidelines for the community; I must say, it's hard not to love the official [Don't be a Dick policy](https://github.com/hachyderm/community#dont-be-a-dick-policy), which I'm hoping will shut up at least a few of the insufferable loudmouths I've had to endure over the past several months. So I'm excited, to say the least. Fingers crossed --- we'll see how this goes.

Oh! And here's where you'll find me: <https://hachyderm.io/@cnunciato>.
