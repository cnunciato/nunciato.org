I'll be honest: I don't _fully_ know what I'm doing, [bailing on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cnunciato/status/1594361226066563072) and [moving to Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@cnunciato), except that it feels like the right thing to do, and it definitely feels like the right time to do it.

I've heard here and there that [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) is a "different" social experience from Twitter, and I haven't fully taken the time to learn how -- but the thought of continuing to hang around on Twitter, with [Musk](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/technology/elon-musk-twitter-workers-quit.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Technology) at the helm now and [Trump reinstated](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/technology/trump-twitter-musk.html) (not to mention all the _noise_, _ads_, and constant self-promotion -- not my thing), just makes me feel rather sick inside. It just doesn't feel great to hang out there right now. So like Facebook in 2008, it's probably a good time to step out for a while.

So far, [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) looks like an [interesting experiment](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/technology/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk.html?searchResultPosition=5) -- and if the influx of new users over the weekend is any guide, the experiment might actually be working. Most of the people I follow on Twitter are already there, which certainly doesn't hurt. And I love the open and distributed nature of Mastodon, too. Kris [@nova](https://hachyderm.io/@nova) and her colleagues have done an amazing job setting up [hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io) and defining the guidelines for the community, and I must say, it's hard not to love the official [Don't be a Dick policy](https://github.com/hachyderm/community#dont-be-a-dick-policy), which I'm hoping will shut down at least a few of the insufferable loudmouths I've had to endure on Twitter in recent months. So I'm excited, to say the least. Fingers crossed -- we'll see how this goes.

Oh! And here's where you'll find me: <https://hachyderm.io/@cnunciato>.

**Update**: I'm still on Mastodon, but have returned somewhat to Twitter (which I'll always call Twitter), because, well, for better or worse, that where all my humans still are.
