This past weekend, I started homebrewing a Belgian [dubbel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbel) --- my first ever --- and I was surprised at how quickly the fermentation got going, compared to the lazy sputtering I'm used to getting from typical IPAs. This is what it sounded like yesterday afternoon, after one of my trusty plastic stock bubblers got clogged with foam and I had to emergency-rig the fermenter with a makeshift [blowoff tube](https://beerandbrewing.com/when-to-use-a-blow-off-tube/) with a stopper I managed to find just in time. The bubbling ran steadily like this late into the night before calming down again this morning.

Fun times. I'm actually pretty excited about this one. üç∫
