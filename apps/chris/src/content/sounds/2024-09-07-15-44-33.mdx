I'll give you a hint: _The cake is a lie._ =<Icon class="inline-block text-gray-600" name="person-running" />

Sam learned this one totally by ear; I'm not even sure sheet music exists for it. (I did help little; as a nerd, I love this song -- though it's always held a certain poignancy for me.) He plays it a lot, several times a week in the in-between times -- after dinner, when he should be doing his chores, etc. -- almost like a little break from the monotony of routine, and it never fails to delight me. (He also loves Coldplay; if you want to see what I look like when I'm sobbing uncontrollably, just as Sam to play you a little Coldplay sometime.)
