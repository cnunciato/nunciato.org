Sam learned this one by ear; I'm not even sure sheet music exists for it. (I admit I helped a little. As a nerd, I love this song -- although it's always held a certain poignancy for me, too.) He plays it a lot, several times a week in the in-between times -- after dinner, when he should be doing his chores, etc. -- almost like a little break from the monotony of routine, and it never fails to delight me. (He also loves Coldplay. If you ever want to see what I look like sobbing uncontrollably, just as Sam to play us a little Coldplay sometime.)
