That white blur you see in up the cornerthat's rain. These girls were _soaked_. And it was cold out there, too40&deg;F on the sidelines, our toes frozen in our boots. But you'd never know any of this from watching these girls play. They were _amazing_. They played like prospassing, nicking the ball and moving it through crowds of defenders, taking shots (even Rosie took a few) ... it was sublime. At one point late in the second half, when I realized they might actually win (they were the underdogs going in), I almost wept, I was so proud of them. They've come so far, this team of little women, and best of all, they _love_ each other.

Last year, Rosie's first, they didn't win a single game. This year, won all but two. Tonight, the final game of the season, was a shutout, 3-nil. Unbelievable. We can't wait for kickoff next year.
