Rebecca and me debating whether to go to the [OL Reign](https://www.olreign.com/) game downtown today. The big oval is [Lumen Field](https://www.lumenfield.com/events-tickets/ol-reign), the squiggly line on the right is Elliott Bay, the box with the &times; is where our seats are, and the wadded-up napkin in the "sky" that Rebecca's holding is my rough guess as to where the sun will be when the game _starts_ this afternoon.
