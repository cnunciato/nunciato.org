I needed a final slide for a talk I was preparing for [CascadiaJS](https://2019.cascadiajs.com/), and I couldn't find anything that really said what I wanted to say, so I figured what the heck --- I'd just shoot something myself. Since the talk is about infrastructure tools, I thought it'd be fun to have my son, Oliver, hold a wrench up to the camera, arm outstretched, as though he were offering it to the viewer -- but he's ten, and the wrench I'd chosen was a large cast-iron pipe wrench, which is a heavy piece of equipment. As I stood there trying to get the shot, he'd struggle to keep the thing held up as long as he could, eventually having to let it go for a break. It was fun. I'm surprised he wasn't sore the next day.

Good job, Littleman.
