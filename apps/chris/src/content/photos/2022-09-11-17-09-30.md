Rebecca made this for our wedding. It sat on top of our cake. Beside it is a companion cube, a gift from me not long after that. Elsewhere are various artifacts and evidence of our relationship over the past 15 years: dancing at a friend's wedding, visits to Portland, sailing with kids. What an incredible journey it's been.

Catches me by surprise sometimes.
