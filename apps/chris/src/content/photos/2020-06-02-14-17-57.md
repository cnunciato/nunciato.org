Today, we got out. I took a long lunch and we drove out to Brackett's Landing for a walk along the beach, our first outing as a family since mid-March. Felt good. It rained, unexpectedly, but we didn't mind. It was good to see a few other humans out and about as well (though sadly, most without masks) and life generally continuing.
