The finished product of Project #2 from [_Rubber Band Engineer_](https://www.amazon.com/Rubber-Band-Engineer-Slingshot-Unconventional)a PVC slingshot. After the first cut didn't quite work out, I decided to add a few enhancements of my own, aimed (no pun intended, but I'll take it) at making the design a bit more modular, using [paracord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute_cord) for the attachments to the frame and the pocket. Metallic blue spray-paint (left over from the bike we built for Sam last year) finished things off nicely.

It's totally inaccurate, of course; you couldn't hit anything with this. But we had fun making it.
