Twenty-eight days after getting our first vaccines, we drove up at this same location and got our seconds, Rebecca in her left arm, mine (once again as passenger) in my right. We were in and out in 15 minutes, and I was back in time for a ten o'clock meeting.

That we did thisthat we humans were able to create and distribute a vaccine as complex as this one to outsmart a virus as complex as COVID-19 within the span of a single yearcontinues to amaze me, and probably always will. Eventually I'll figure out how to write about it. What a year this has been. I'm ready for it to end, but at the same time, I'm not sure I'm quite ready to leave it behind.
