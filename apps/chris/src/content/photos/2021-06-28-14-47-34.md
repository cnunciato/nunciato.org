I've had this little portable air conditioner since at least 2001, when I lived in a little brick building in California that'd heat up like an oven in the summer and _stay_ hot until sometimes two or three in the morning, and it (the air conditioner) is still going strong. I'm sure there are far more efficient, higher-performing models out there today, but I'm happy to have this little guy still with me.
