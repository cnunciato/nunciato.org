They love making these, and I love all of them. The detail constantly amazes me, too. I think they're made with something called Sculpie, which the kids buy with their own money in little solid-colored bundles that go for two bucks apiece.

It's been a while since we visited the art store in Seattle. I miss that place a lot, come to think of it. I'm sure they do, too.
