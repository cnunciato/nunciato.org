They can't do it &mdash; they promise they'll try, but they can't. Somehow, whatever neural pathways have to be forged and then stabilized before we, as humans, are able to successfully remove, track the location of, and finally restore the cap of a tube of toothpaste simply do not exist in children, period. I don't even know where the caps _go_ anymore -- they just ... _disappear_.
