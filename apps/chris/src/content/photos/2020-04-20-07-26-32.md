Toughest puzzle ever: on the whole, it took us a month to do it. But it was fun. Many thanks to Oliver who really helped pull it together toward the end.

And yes, sadly, those two pieces do seem to have been lost -- casualties of daily cleanup, vacuuming, and who knows what else. The dog might well have eaten them, too, for that matter. But I'm okay with it.

Next project: framing it up and hanging it in the library.
