# Things to Do

* When we merge to master, we need to
  * Determine the appropriate, next semantic version, based on, like, something (current tag, or 0.0.1?)
  * Make a tar.gz consisting of the whole project, named somehow with that new version
  * Apply a git tag with that version
  * Push a GitHub "pre-release" with that tag
  * Push the tar.gz either to S3 or GitHub
